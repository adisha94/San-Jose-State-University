This is a file that is designed to tell what goes on in this small training program.


This program helps us to prepare for the test in CMPE 30 (final try#2) which is to take place tomorrow at 9:30 AM in the engineering builing at SJSU unless otherwise notified or specified or whatever. What ever the case is, there is a lot of things that need to be done in order to make this work out for us.
