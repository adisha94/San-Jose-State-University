# CMPE 50 Labs

This is a repository for my class assignments and labs for CMPE 50 (Object Oriented Programming and Methodology) in San Jose State University. Feel free to give suggestions as these class assignments may provide templates for larger projects in the future. Feel free to comment and suggest changes so that I can improve on my own programming skills for the future. This is open to the public if anyone needs any help for any starting points for projects that they might need help with.

I have also included some helper files so that peope can benefit from a cleaner console screen whenever they need it. Feel free to comment on the code if you so wish. If you wish to make changees to the code itself, please create a pull request so that I can take a look at it before making the proposed changes.

For those students who are currently taking CMPE 50 in San Jose State University currently (at the time of uploading), please do not copy directly from the lab because it will be considered as cheating and will be reported. You may base your code off this but DO NOT copy complete lines or portions of the code to avoid cheating. I am being generous to you people so please use this as a reference only. This should help in the future.

For those who seem to have compatibility issues, these files have been created using XCode on my Macbook. Editing will be optional for other users from what I have heard from people in recent times.

Have a great day and stay tuned for uploads and updates.

Update:
To avoid future cheaters who might be looking for direct answers in the future this repository will be taken down once the course has ended at the end of the semester.
