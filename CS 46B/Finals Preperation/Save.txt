His investment in the fertile land gave him access to the then very fertile soil of the Santa Clara Valley.
When Mr. Lick arrived in Santa Clara, he took advantage of the soil by planting all kinds of imported fruits The mansion appears to represent the results of his projects, since he was grew imported pears, apricots, and plums around his estate (cite).
When I went to the site however, none of these fruits could be found. 
What is interesting is that Mr. Lick knew that his field of agriculture was a risky field to do business in. So he bought land where he knew the soil was nice and fertile.
Thanks to his business investments, Mr. Lick was able to reap the profits of the land and make his wealth in the process. This demonstrated his sheer knowledge of horticultural, a tactic in agriculture and his sleazy business practices. â€¨
