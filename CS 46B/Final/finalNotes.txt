/**
   A polygon with a number of Point2D.Double corners. As you know from midterms 1 
   and 2, a polygon can be decomposed into two smaller polygons with the same 
   (or almost the same) number of vertices.  Assume the polygon has corners 
   c[0] ... c[n - 1]. Decompose it into two polygons with corners c[0] ...c[k] and 
   c[k] ... c[n - 1] c[0]. If n is odd, then the first one has one more corner
   than the second one.

   Have this class implement the Decomposable interface. Triangles are not
   decomposable. Polygons with > 3 corners can be decomposed as described.
