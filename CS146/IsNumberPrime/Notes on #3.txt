Exercise 2.20

a. Write a program to determine if a positive integer, N, is prime.b. In terms of N, what is the worst-case running time of your program? (You shouldbe able to do this in O( N).)c. Let B equal the number of bits in the binary representation of N. What is thevalue of B?d. In terms of B, what is the worst-case running time of your program?e. Compare the running times to determine if a 20-bit number and a 40-bit numberare prime.f. Is it more reasonable to give the running time in terms of N or B? Why?
